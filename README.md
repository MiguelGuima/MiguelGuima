### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on applying Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to private data, e.g. enterprise sensitive data that don't want public exposure, and interact with that data like ChatGPT but providing real facts based on the company's data. This way we fight the problem of hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on how to personalize and adapt the answers given by LLMs to meet the specific User needs, tacking into account the User context, knowledge, experience, goal, etc.
